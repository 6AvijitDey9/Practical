/* Problem 4: 
 * Create a class MyCalculator which consists of a single method long power(int, int).
This method takes two integers, n and p, as parameters and finds n^p . If either n or
p is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "n or p should
not be negative.". Also, if both n and p are zero, then the method must throw an
exception which says "n and p should not be zero."
Input Format
Each line of the input contains two integers, n and p.
Output Format
Each line of the output contains the result, if both n and p are positive. If either n or p
is negative, the output contains "n and p should be non-negative". If both n and p are
zero, the output contains "n and p should not be zero.".
