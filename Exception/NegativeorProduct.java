/* Problem 2 :
Take two numbers x and y. Throw the exception if the two numbers are negative else print the 
Product of x and y.
Input Format:
The only line of input consist of two integers, x and y.
Constraints
-20<= x, y <=20
Output Format:
Print the product if both are positive else print the output as below:
java.lang.Exception: x and y should not be zero. */
